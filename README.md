Inspiring Women in Tech Dashboard

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project is to celebrate the achievements of women in technology and highlight their impact on the field. Despite the challenges, many women have made groundbreaking contributions to tech, inspiring future generations. This project aims to shed light on their stories and encourage more women to pursue careers in STEM.

## What it does

The "Inspiring Women in Tech Dashboard" showcases the stories and accomplishments of notable women in technology. It features profiles of influential women, displaying key details about their contributions, notable achievements, and personal quotes. The dashboard also includes data visualisations showing statistics on gender representation in tech fields, making it both educational and motivational.

## How I built it

1. **Data Collection**: I researched and gathered data on notable women in tech, including their contributions, achievements, and inspirational quotes.
2. **Dashboard Development**: I built an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore profiles, view stats, and read about these inspiring figures.
3. **Data Visualisation**: I integrated charts with `Matplotlib` to display statistics on gender representation in the tech industry over time.
4. **User Interface**: Designed an accessible and visually appealing layout with easy navigation and clear presentation of information.

## Challenges I ran into

1. **Data Sourcing**: Finding accurate, reliable data on women's contributions to tech was challenging and time-consuming.
2. **Visualisation Decisions**: Choosing the best way to represent data in a meaningful and engaging way required multiple iterations.
3. **Balancing Scope and Time**: Implementing all planned features within the limited time frame of the hackathon required careful prioritisation.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

- Creating a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that effectively highlights the achievements of women in tech.
- Successfully integrating visualisations that present statistics in an accessible, impactful manner.
- Bringing attention to the accomplishments of women in technology and providing inspiration for future generations.

## What I've learned

Throughout this project, I learned how to structure biographical data, use Python for data visualisation, and create an interactive user interface. 

## What's next for My First Hackathon

Future enhancements for the project include:
- Adding more profiles to expand the diversity of figures highlighted.
- Including real-time data on gender representation trends in tech.
- Implementing user engagement features, like a "Favourite Profile" option, and adding resources for women interested in tech careers.
- Exploring ways to make the dashboard more interactive and immersive, perhaps by integrating videos or interviews.
